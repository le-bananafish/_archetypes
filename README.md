# _archetypes

This repository was created to track and manage the templates, formatting, annotation, and other conventions that I use with my writing projects. Originally created to manage the [New Horizons](#) project, it was spun off into its own repository to ease syncing conventions between different writing projects.

## Directory structure and contents

    _article.md             - a template for article-style documents
    _story.md               - a template for story-style or narrative-based documents
    _meta.md                - details my annotation conventions (tags)
